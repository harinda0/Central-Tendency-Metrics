# Central Tendency Metrics Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed analysis of central tendency metrics, including mean, median, and mode. The notebook focuses on summarizing key variables such as fertility, education, and the Catholic population. The analysis provides insights into the distribution of these variables and how the choice of central tendency measure can affect interpretation.

## Key Insights
- Exploration of mean, median, and mode.
- Practical examples to demonstrate the application of central tendency metrics.
- Examination of data distribution and skewness to choose the best metric.

## Files in this Repository
- `Central_Tendency_Metrics.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the analysis.
- `Central_Tendency_Metrics.html`: HTML version of the notebook.
- `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a solid foundation for understanding how central tendency metrics can be used to summarize and interpret data distributions.
